PHP - Like all interface modules, provides a bridge between the front-end
and back-end. Provides API for front-end allowing front end to forward analysis 
requests and get analysis responses	

Analysis Server - System that takes analysis requests, processes the requests,
and returns an analysis response. Composed of an analysis gateway, an 
analysis engine, and analysis units

	Analysis Gateway - The gateway for all traffic coming into and out of
		the analysis server. Decodes JSON and validates that incoming analysis 
		requests are properly formatted and formed. Relays analysis response
		to analysis engine so that the analysis engine can actually execute
		the analysis. Receives an analysis response from the engine and outputs
		the response
	
	Analysis Engine - Receives a properly formatted analysis request from 
		the analysis gateway. Determines the type of analysis requested. If
		the requested analysis type is valid, includes the relevant analysis
		unit and passes the request to the initialization function of the 
		analysis unit. Receives a result set from the appropriate unit.
		Places the result set along with the status of the analysis in an
		analysis response list. Encodes the analysis response in JSON and 
		returns it to the analysis gateway

	Analysis Units - Scripts that take an analysis request and execute
		a specific type of statistical analysis. Package results into a
		result set and returns the result set to the analysis engine 


Analysis Request - An object that exists in JSON form, as an associative array,
	and an R list at different points during its existence. Like all Visustat
	objects, it contains a class field. In addition it contains a type field
	specifying the type of analysis requested, an independent variable field,
	a dependent variables field, a data field containing a dataset object, 
	and an optional field containing different options unique to a specific
	analysis

Analysis Response - An object that contains a class field, status field,
	and result set field

Result Set - A sub-object containg all the information returned by a given 
	analysis (ex: p-value, test-statistic, df, etc). Generated by appropriate
	analysis unit 




NOTES:

Make it so analysis engine can only be called from analysis gateway? Perhaps
same from engine?
